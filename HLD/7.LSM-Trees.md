# LSM Tree

### HashMap issues
1. Old entries are not removed
2. For 100B keys, hashmap doesn't fit in RAM
3. If system crashes, RAM data is lost
4. Sharding


### LSM Tree

* Maintain a hasmap with key, and offset in the file as value
* The write ahead log is a file, which is used to append and get only.
* File can be in PB
* Map may not fit in RAM
* Duplicate entries in file
