# Choreography vs Orchestration

* Way of organizing workflows

## Orchestration
* Decision logic is centralized
* Let there be a single brain that exactly tells other what to do.


## Choreography
* Decision logic is distributed
* Instead of having a single brain, let each service be independent to think 
what needs to be done upon getting to know what happened.
* Need of robust distributed tracing to find the workflow state.
