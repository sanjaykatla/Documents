# Maintainability

It is very well known that the majority of the cost of software
is not in its initial development, but it is in its ongoing maintainance.

We can and should design the software such a way that it will
hopefully minimizes the pain during the maintenance, and thus
avoiding legacy software ourselves.

Three principles
#### Operability
* Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly

#### Simplicity
* Make it easy for new joiners to understand the system, by 
removing the as complexity as possible in the system

#### Evolvability
* Make it easy for engineers to make the changes to the system
in the future, adapting it for un anticipated use cases as
requirements change. Also known as extensibility, modifiability,
or plasticity


## Operability: Making Life Easy for operations

* It has been suggested that "good operations often work around
the limitations of bad software, but good software can't run
reliably with bad operations"
* Operations teams are vital to keeping the software running smoothly.
* A good operations team is responsible for following or more
  * Monitoring the health of the system, quickly restoring the
  system if it goes into the bad state
  * Tracing down the cause of the problems, such as system failures,
  and degraded performance
  * Keeping the software and platform up to date
  * Establishing good practices and tools deployment, configuration
  management.

## Evolvability: Making Change Easy
* Agile working patterns provide a framework for adapting changes.
